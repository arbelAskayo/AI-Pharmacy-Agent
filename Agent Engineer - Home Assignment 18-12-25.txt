Home Assignment - Agent Engineer
Context
1.​ Overview
a.​ As an Agent Engineer in the Agent Engineering group, you will be part of a
team of agent engineers who build the best enterprise-grade AI agents.
b.​ The company is developing an AI-powered pharmacist assistant for a retail
pharmacy chain. The agent will serve customers through chat, using data
from the pharmacy’s internal systems.
c.​ Customers will ask about medications, stock availability, prescription
requirements, and safe usage.
d.​ The agent must follow strict policies to provide factual information only, while
avoiding any form of medical advice or diagnosis.
2.​ Assignment Objectives - Build real-time conversational AI pharmacy agent, on
OpenAI API. The agent expected to handle workflows through tools: prescription
management, inventory control, and customer service.
Requirements
1.​ AI Agent - Implement real-time text streaming AI agent based on GPT-5 (key
provided separately). The agent is state-less, and can talk both in Hebrew and
English.
2.​ Tool - Design and implement agent’s tools
3.​ Database - Create a synthetic database of 10 users and 5 medicals.
4.​ UI - Interact with the agent, with show tool calls.
5.​ Multi-Step Flow - Design and implement at least three distinct multi-step flows the
agent can execute
6.​ Evaluation Plan - Provide an evaluation plan for your agent.
7.​ Docker - Wrap your project in a Docker file.
Guidelines
1.​ Backend Language - Python, JavaScript, TypeScript or Go (no limitation for the
frontend).
2.​ OpenAI API Vanilla - Langchain or similar frameworks are not allowed.
3.​ AI assistant - You may collaborate with any AI assistant (Claude Code, Codex, etc.)
during development. However, you are expected to be prepared to explain the code
and answer questions about implementation decisions.
Agent Requirements
These are the minimum requirements the agent must meet. You may propose and include
additional requirements if you believe they are important for production readiness.
1.​ Provide factual information about medications.
2.​ Explain dosage and usage instructions.
3.​ Confirm prescription requirements.
4.​ Check availability in stock.
5.​ Identify active ingredients.
6.​ No medical advice, no encouragement to purchase, no diagnosis.

7.​ Redirect to a healthcare professional or general resources for advice requests.
8.​ Streaming
Flows to Design
The agent should be able to execute at least three distinct multi-step flows. A multi-step flow
is the expected sequence of actions an agent follows in a real use case, covering all the
steps a professional would take when assisting a customer from the start of their request to
its resolution.
Define each flow, describe the expected sequence, and outline how the agent will use the
functions and respond.
Function (Tool) Design Requirements
At minimum, design 3 different tools, for example:
1.​ get_medication_by_name: Inputs, outputs, example responses, error handling,
fallback logic.
2.​ Additional tools may be added if justified.
For each function, document:
1.​ Name and purpose
2.​ Inputs (parameters, types)
3.​ Output schema (fields, types)
4.​ Error handling
5.​ Fallback behavior
Deliverables
In a public GitHub repository, please provide:
1.​ README.md - Explanation of the project and its architecture, explanation of how to
run the Docker. Write it down by yourself and do not use LLM to write it.
2.​ Multi-Step Flow - Three multi-step workflow demonstrations.
3.​ Evidence - 2-3 screenshots of conversations.
4.​ Evaluation Plan - Evaluate the Agent flows.
Evaluation Criteria
1.​ Tool/API design clarity.
2.​ Prompt quality and integration of API usage.
3.​ Multi-step interaction handling.
4.​ Policy adherence.
5.​ Testing rigor (coverage in Hebrew, multiple variations per flow).
6.​ Quality and completeness of flow designs.
Good luck!
